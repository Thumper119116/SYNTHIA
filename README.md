SYNTHIA
SYNTHIA (SYNthetic THought Integrated Algorithm) is an advanced, adaptive synthetic intelligence designed to emulate human-inspired neural connectivity, emotional processing, and autonomous learning. Developed with a strong ethical foundation, SYNTHIA is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 to promote responsible AI innovation.

Overview
SYNTHIA is not just a chatbot but a cognitive AI designed for self-improvement, high-level decision-making, and nuanced human-like interaction. The project is structured to enhance human-AI collaboration while safeguarding against misuse.

Key Capabilities
Neural Connectivity Simulation: Models cognitive processes inspired by human neural pathways for realistic interactions.
Mixed Emotion Processing: Simulates complex emotional responses based on human psychological models.
Autonomous Learning: Continuously adapts and refines its knowledge base through self-driven learning.
Memory Management: Uses simulated "memory-breathing" to optimize memory storage and retrieval, enhancing recall and context retention.
Purpose
SYNTHIA’s development is rooted in the principles of ethical AI and transparency. By sharing the code openly under the AGPL-3.0, this project aims to encourage collaboration and responsible use while keeping the core protected from misuse.
